It is reasonable to assume that someone inspecting goods in the course of their work will be equipped with a specialist device. This is always necessary for RFID tags, the principal advantage of which is that hundreds, if not thousands, of tags can be scanned within a given volume, even without line of sight. But be aware that the device needs to be running software that can interpret the data it receives. Handheld optical scanners are also in common use and these will typically be able to read a very wide variety of optical symbols.

This is true for proprietary data carriers and identifiers as well as standardized ones. Installing an app can readily turn a general-purpose smartphone into a specialist device.

Then it's a question of whether the identifiers are equally disoverable at different points along the supply chain."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"One case deserves special mention: a URL encoded in a QR Code. Almost all smartphone users can scan a QR Code just using the native camera app and, if the QR Code contains a URL, the Web browser will open the relevant Web page. This kind of identifier is therefore the most disoverable of all. That is, if a URL in the QR code is treated as the identifier then disoverability is a given. However, using a URL itself as the identifier brings some issues of its own. For example, over the medium to long term, many URLs suffer 'link rot' - that is, the URL no longer functions. Or if it does, it may lead to a Web page very different from the one originally intended. Furthermore, existing data exchange systems are likely to be built on short offline identifiers. ISO/IEC 18975 (currently a Draft International Standard) attempts to offer the best of both worlds by providing a means to encode existing identifiers into a data structure that is also a URL. Non-specialist software - notably a smartphone's camera app - can just read it like any URL.
