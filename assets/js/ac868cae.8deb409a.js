For high volume goods and easy / reliable discovery, these identifiers are already typically represented as barcodes, matrix codes, QR codes, or RFID encoded data. UNTP supports the use of these existing data carriers. A basic UNTP principle is that if you have a product then you should be able to find ESG data about that product even when the identifier is not a web link. Therefore, the UNTP defines a generalised protocol (based on ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.iso.org/standard/85540.html"},"ISO/IEC DIS 18975"),") to allow any identifier scheme (GS1 or otherwise) to be consistently resolvable so that product passports and other data can always be accessed from the identifier of the product. The UNTP also defines a specific QR based data carrier format for use on paper/PDF versions of conformity credentials or other trade documents that provides secure access to credentials in a way that is both human and machine readable.

Applying this to UNTP, when looking for information about a product the user will want the DPP, certificates covering ESG issues and conformance, perhaps manufacturer's details.
