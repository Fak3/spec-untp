To achieve this, UNTP defines six data confidentiality patterns with different degrees of data protection so that they can be appropriately combined to meet the confidentiality goals of each party.

The UNTP solution to this problem involves trusted third parties (certifiers or industry associations) to act as quota managers that issue "guarantee of origin" credentials (a type of conformity credential). In this model, the guarantee of origin certificate for 10 Tons of cotton fabric (for example) can only be issued when the third party has evidence of the purchase of at least 10 Tons sustainable input materials.
