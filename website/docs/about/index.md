# About the UNTP

The United nations Transparency Protocol (UNTP) aims to supporting governments and industry with practical measures to counter greenwashing by implementing supply chain traceability and transparency at the scale needed to achieve meaningful impacts on global sustainability outcomes.

NOTE - this website is under development and is not ready for implementation. The UNTP should be complete and implenentable by June 2024.
