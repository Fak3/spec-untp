## Overview

The ESG footprint of a finished product is the aggregation of it's components and processes through the value chain. Verification of ESG claims therefore involves assessing a bundle of linked credentials (aka a "trust graph") drawn from all or part of a value chain. Whilst each credential may be valid in it's own right, one challenge is verifying the context of related credentials. For example, a conformity assessment body that is accredited to test strength of structured steel might not be accredited to issue emissions intensity certificates. A technically valid emissions certificate linked to a technically valid accreditation certificate that has a different scope would be fraudulent. To address this problem, the UNTP defines a simple method to verify the contextual scope of linked credentials. Essentially this provides a mechanism to verify a linked graph of data at a layer above individual credential verification.
