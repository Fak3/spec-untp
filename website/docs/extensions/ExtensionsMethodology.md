# Overview

UNTP is designed as a common core that is usable by any industry sector or in any regulatory jurisdiction. This extensions methodology describes how to extend UNTP to meet the specific needs of any industry sector or regulated market in such a way that the extension maintains core interoperability with any other extension.  This cross-industry and cross-border interoperability is a core value of UNTP because almost every value chain will cross industry and/or national borders.

In some cases, UNTP extensions are themselves UN projects - such as the extnesions defined by the [UN critical raw materials traceability and transparency project](https://uncefact.github.io/project-crm/). In most cases however, industry sectors and/or national projects will govern their own extensions. 

To be registered as UNTP conformant, an extension MUST remain interoperable with UNTP. This is achieved by limiting extensions to the extension points described below and be completing interoperability testing.
