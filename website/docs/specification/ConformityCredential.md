## Overview

Conformity credentials are usually issued by independent third parties and provide a **trusted assessment** of product ESG performance against credible **standards or regulations**. As such the credential provides trusted verification of the ESG claims in the passport. Since the passport may make several independent claims (eg emissions intensity, deforestation free, fair work, etc) there may be many linked conformity credentials referenced by one passport. As an additional trust layer, the conformity credential may reference an **accreditation** credential that attests to the authority of the third party to perform the specific ESG assessments. The conformity credential data model has been developed by a separate UN/CEFACT project on digital conformity that has expert membership from accreditation authorities and conformity assessment bodies.
