## Overview

The UNTP is agnostic of any technology or any identifier system. Nevertheless, GS1 is by far the most widely used scheme for product identification, particularly at the downstream / consumer end of the value chain. Billions of unique product/shipment identifiers have been issued and over 5 billion product barcode scans happen around the world every day. UNTP does not require any actor to adopt GS1 standards and identifiers, but it certainly must facilitate existing GS1 users to adopt the UNTP. To this end, the UNTP defines a specific binding that shows how existing GS1 users can leverage their existing investments when implementing the UNTP.
