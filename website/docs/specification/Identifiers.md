## Overview

Identifiers of **businesses** (eg tax registration numbers), of **locations** (eg google pins or cadastral/lot numbers), and of **products** (eg GS1 GTINs or other schemes) are ubiquitous throughout supply chains and underpin the integrity of the system. UNTP builds upon existing identifier schemes without precluding the use of new schemes so that existing investments and high integrity registers can be leveraged. UNTP requires four key features of the identifiers and, for those that don't already embody these features, provides a framework to uplift the identifier scheme to meet UNTP requirements. Identifiers used in UNTP implementations should be **discoverable** (ie easily read by scanning a barcode, QR code, or RFID), **globally unique** (ie by adding a domain prefix to local schemes), **resolvable** (ie given an identifier, there is a standard way to find more data about the identified thing), and **verifiable** (ie ownership of the identifier can be verified so that actors cannot make claims about identifiers they don't own).
