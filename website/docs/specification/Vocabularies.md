## Overview

Web **vocabularies** are a means to bring consistent understanding of **meaning** to ESG claims and assessments throughout transparent value chains based on UNTP. There are hundreds of ESG standards and regulations around the world, each with dozens or hundreds of specific conformity **criteria**. Any given value chain from raw materials to finished product is likely to include dozens of passports and conformity credentials issued against any of thousands of ESG criteria. Without a consistent means to make sense of this data, UNTP would provide a means to discover a lot of data but no easy way to make sense of it. The UNTP defines a standard and extensible topic map (taxonomy) of ESG criteria and provides a mechanism for any standards authority, or national regulator, or industry association to map their specific terminology to the UNTP vocabulary.
