# Specification

Digital Product Passports enable consumers insights to the upstream supply chain of a product. These insights are built from a verifiable graph of product claims, asserted by relevant trust anchors along the supply chain.

The motivation of Digital Product Passports is to promote and enable product repairs, reuse, and recycle, as well as enabling consumers a cryptographically verifiable basis on which to make purhase decisions.

This spec describes a protocol for establishing the initial link from the product to the root-level DPP and from there contruct of the larger DPP graph.
